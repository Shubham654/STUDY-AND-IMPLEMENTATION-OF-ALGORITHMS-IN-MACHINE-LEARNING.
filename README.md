# STUDY-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-ALGORITHMS-IN-MACHINE-LEARNING.
Created a mini project in college with my teammates on the topic of comparative study and implementation of ML algorithms.
This Project contains the kNN implementation from scratch using python.
Created our own kNN function in python as shown below to predict the given handwritten digit.
